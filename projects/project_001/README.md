# Project 1 README
This is a quick README describing some of the contents of this folder.  Please refer to formal documentation and details provided in class and online forums for the approved answers to any questions.

## project_001/
This directory.  It contains a couple of subdirectories, described later, and both this document and the assignment.  This is also where you should do your work.

## example_tbs/
This folder contains one example testbench that will be used to grade your implmentation.  It contains the top level testbench, an implementation of a stimulus engine, and a file that feeds the engine with data.  Essentially, the testbench instantiates a DUT and the engine.  When run, the engine reads how it's supposed to stimulate the DUT from the data file.  You are free to use this example to test your design and you may use the testbench, engine, and data file as starting points to build your own testbenches.

## encrypted_soln/
This directory contains a complete solution to the project in encrypted form.  You may use this as a DUT to test against and compare your implementation.  Note, however, that the encrypted solution is just one example of a functional solution and that your timing may be different and still be correct.
